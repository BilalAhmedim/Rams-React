The copper we use is only the finest of solid copper and our sinks are completely food-safe i.e. we also provide Lab testing report verifying the genuineness of copper.

            Our packing is very exclusive having the norms of UPS packaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use polythene bags + bubbler + PU Foam. Thence we put it into strong plywood case. We pack the Tubs/Sinks inside the cases in such a manner that movement inside the cases is impossible. The inside of case is “lined” with various materials e.g. stout & damp resisting paper etc. to prevent the damage by water, air, or insects. In addition, the goods is wrapped & generously padded to avoid scratching and knocking against the cases.
